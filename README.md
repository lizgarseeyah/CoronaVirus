# Covid-19 Datascience project

This project uses an API generated through Microsoft’s App Registration to collect data from The COVID-19 Tracking Project website. The data is exported to a desktop file. A python program imports the data from the local drive to be processed for analytics.

Part I: Creating the API to access the COVID-19 data
Download Postman, an API Interface App.
Register the app using Microsoft Graph.
Add proper permissions: “Files.ReadWrite.Selected”
Run the python script below to generate a URL to access the COVID-19 web data.

![URL Generation Code Snippet](https://octodex.github.com/images/yaktocat.png)

The URL will use the created API to directly access the data.
